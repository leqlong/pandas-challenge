Module 4 Challenge

Background

	In this project, I will analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I am given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance to help make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

School Results Analysis

	The dataset encompasses a total of 15 schools, 39,170 students, with the average math score of 78.99 (passing rate at 74.98%) and the average reading score of 81.88 (passing rate at 85.81%). The overall passing rate is 65.17%. 
 
	The school budget indicates the amount of money each school spends on each student. The spending ranges per student at <$585 has the highest overall passing rate (90.37%) and gradually decreases as the spending ranges increase. The highest range ($645-680) yields only 53.52% overall passing rate. 
 
	The school size indicates the number of students per school. Medium-size schools (1000-2000) have the highest overall passing rate of 90.62%, and small-size schools come close with 89.88% passing rate. Large-size schools have significantly lower passing rate of 58.27.
 
	These schools are divided into 2 types: Charter and District. Charter schools have a 90.43% passing rate, significantly higher than district schools with a 53.67% passing rate.
